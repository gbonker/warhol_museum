		  <h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
		  <div>
		    <p><strong>Andy Warhol</strong> (August 6, 1928 - February 22, 1987) 
			was an American artist who was a leading figure in the visual art 
			movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between 
			artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that 
			flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial 
			illustrator, Warhol became a renowned and sometimes controversial 
			artist. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city, Pittsburgh, 
			Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and 
			archives. It is the largest museum in the United States of America 
			dedicated to a single artist.</p>

		<p>Warhol's artwork ranged in many forms of media that include hand 
			drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, 
			film, and music. He was a pioneer in computer-generated art using 
			Amiga computers that were introduced in 1985, just before his death 
			in 1987. He founded <em>Interview Magazine</em> and was the author 
			of numerous books, including <em>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and 
			Popism: The Warhol Sixties.</em> Andy Warhol is also notable as a 
			homosexual man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation 
			movement. His studio, The Factory, was a famous gathering place that 
			brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, 
			playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and 
			wealthy patrons.</p>

		<p>Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, 
			books, and feature and documentary films. He coined the widely used 
			expression "15 minutes of fame." Many of his creations are very 
			collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a 
			Warhol painting is US $100 million for a 1963 canvas titled <em>Eight 
			Elvises.</em> The private transaction was reported in a 2009 article 
			in The Economist, which described Warhol as the "bellwether of the art 
			market." Warhol's works include some of the most expensive paintings
			ever sold.</p>

		  <h3><strong>Warhol's College Years</strong></h3>
		  <div>
		    <p><p>When he entered the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie 
			Mellon University) as a freshman in 1945, Andrew Warhola embarked on 
			the formal road to what would become one of the most celebrated art 
			careers of the 20th-century. With America embroiled in the final 
			throes of World War II and the steel mills and factories of Pittsburgh 
			churning out heavy materials at full tilt, the rarefied world of the 
			academy (with classes taught by artists Balcomb Greene, Robert Lepper, 
			Samuel Rosenberg, and Howard Worner, among others) would have been a 
			comforting realm within which the future Andy Warhol (he dropped the 
			final "a" in the 1950s to make his name seem less ethnic) could 
			develop his aesthetic voice. The day before he entered college, 
			Warhol sat for a portrait photo in a small photo studio operated by 
			his middle brother, John, and their cousin Johnny Preksta. 
			Interestingly enough, in relation to Warhol's yet-to-come work of the 
			early-1960s, it consisted of a photobooth machine, and the customers 
			received not just the black-and-white product, but a hand-colored 
			portrait. However, from 1945-1946, Warhol struggled with his 
			first-year classes in the Department of Painting and Design, 
			resulting in him having to take a summer drawing class so that he 
			could refine his draftsmanship to please his professors.</p>
			
		<p>The drawings made in the summer of 1946 are technically mature images 
			of women buying fruits and vegetables on the streets of Warhol's 
			childhood neighborhood of South Oakland, mere blocks away from 
			Carnegie Tech. Warhol spent many days that summer observing his 
			oldest brother, Paul, who sold produce from a truck, and the 
			resultant pictures that he made of those commercial transactions won 
			Warhol accolades upon his return to school in the fall when he 
			received the Martin B. Leisser Prize and had the works exhibited in 
			the college's fine arts gallery. From that point forward, Warhol was 
			a star student in the program and, over the course of his entire 
			college career, learned all of the many skills that a successful 
			commercial illustrator would be expected to know in the job market.</p>  
			
		<p>While at Carnegie Tech, Warhol became involved in various student 
			activities, including the Modern Dance Club (he was the only male in 
			the group) and the Beaux Arts Society. He worked as an editor of the 
			student publication <em>Cano</em>, designing a cover for the magazine 
			in November 1948. His artistic experimentations in 1947 and 1948 led 
			him to develop what would one day become his signature drawing style 
			-- the blotted line technique -- in which he would ink an image in 
			reverse on a vellum-like paper and then tamp it down onto a clean 
			sheet of paper, resulting in a drippy and imperfect line that was 
			slightly reminiscent of artist Ben Shahn, but still highly unique 
			and playful. In the summer between his sophomore and junior years, 
			Warhol took a summer job in the display department of Horne's 
			Department Store in downtown Pittsburgh where he continued to hone 
			his skills of selling products through visual enticement.</p>  
			
		<p>Warhol's involvement with the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh - 
			group of regional artists now celebrating its 100th-anniversary - 
			was both positive and negative to the young artist. In 1948, two of 
			Warhol's works were selected for inclusion in the AAP's annual juried 
			show, a painting titled <em>I Like Dance</em> and a print titled 
			<em>Dance in Black and White.</em> The titles alone show Warhol's 
			great interest in dance, and in fact he once said that he would 
			rather have been a ballerina than an artist. However, unfortunately, 
			his fellow members of the Modern Dance Club thought that Warhol's 
			skills would best be utilized in designing the group's programs in 
			lieu of him actually taking to the stage. His important Dance Diagram 
			paintings from the early 1960s would ultimately find their 
			inspiration in Warhol's early forays into the subject.</p>
			
		<p>The following year, Warhol tasted the thrill of aesthetic controversy 
			when he was rejected from the 1949 AAP juried exhibition after 
			submitting his <em>The Broad Gave Me My Face, But I Can Pick My Own 
			Nose</em> painting at the beginning of his last semester of his 
			senior year. Featuring a young man gingerly picking his nose, the 
			facial details of the painting suggest that it is a self-portrait of 
			Warhol, no doubt thumbing his nose at the establishment as he would 
			do throughout his lifetime. The jury declined to accept the work over 
			the protests of juror George Grosz, the elderly German artist who 
			was known for his caricatures of society.</p>
			
		<p>By his graduation in June 1949, Warhol changed the name of the 
			painting to <em>Don't Pick on Me</em> and submitted it to a student 
			exhibition, where it attracted considerable attention. Recently, 
			several of Warhol's classmates have recalled that the painting was 
			originally titled <em>The Lord Gave Me My Face, But I Can Pick My 
			Own Nose</em>, and it somehow was twisted into the more audacious 
			meaning with the word "broad."</p>
		
		<p>Within weeks of graduating from Carnegie Tech, Warhol and fellow 
			classmate Phillip Pearlstein departed Pittsburgh and moved to New 
			York City, where over the course of their decades-long careers, 
			both would rise to the upper echelons of the art world establishment. 
			Warhol's formative years soaking in the art of commercial illustration 
			would indeed serve him well, first as the most celebrated graphic 
			artist of the 1950s and later on as one of the pioneers of the Pop 
			Art movement of the early 1960s.</p></p>
