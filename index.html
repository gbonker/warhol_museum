		<p>The Andy Warhol Museum has partnered with the Miller Gallery at 
			Carnegie Mellon University to organize an exhibit entitled <strong>"Andy 
			Warhol: A Carnegie Mellon Inspiration"</strong> which will showcase the early 
			life and work of the artist. The Andy Warhol Museum has agreed to 
			loan the Miller Gallery several early pieces for the exhibition.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Andy Warhol</strong> (August 6, 1928 - February 22, 1987) was an American 
			artist who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as 
			pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic 
			expression, celebrity culture and advertisement that flourished by 
			the 1960s.</p>
		
		<p>Warhol was originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and grew up in
			the western Pennsylvania region. Warhol showed early artistic talent 
			and studied commercial art at the School of Fine Arts at Carnegie
			Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). In 1949, 
			he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design.</p>
		
		<p>Today, the Andy Warhol Museum, one of the Carnegie Museums of
			Pittsburgh, is located at 117 Sandusky Street in Pittsburgh,
			Pennsylvania. It is the largest American art museum dedicated 
			to a single artist, holding more than 12,000 works by the Andy 
			Warhol.</p>
